# Implementing various Data structure in C++

# Linked List:
The following operations are implemented:

Insert at start – Add a node at the beginning.

Delete at start – Remove the first node.

Insert at end – Add a node at the end.

Delete at end – Remove the last node.

Insert at position p – Insert a node at a specific position (1-based).

Delete at position p – Delete a node from a specific position.

Insert before value x – Insert a new node before a given value.

Delete by value x – Delete the first node that matches the given value.

Print linked list – Traverse and display all nodes.


Changes to be done:
1- Make code consistent by making all function return type same
2- Use delete instead of free everywhere
