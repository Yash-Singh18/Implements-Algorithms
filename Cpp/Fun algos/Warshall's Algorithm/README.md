# Warshall's Algorithm – Reflexive Closure of a Relation  

## 📌 What does this program do?  
- Takes a **set** from the user.  
- Takes a **relation** on that set as input.  
- Uses **Warshall's Algorithm** to compute the **reflexive closure** of the relation.  

## ❓ Why this program?  
This was part of our **DSGT (Discrete Structures & Graph Theory)** curriculum.  
On exams, we usually solve this problem **by hand on paper**.  
I thought: *if it can be done on paper, why not implement it on a computer too?* 💻  

So, this project is just me translating the pen-and-paper Warshall’s algorithm into a working C++ implementation.
